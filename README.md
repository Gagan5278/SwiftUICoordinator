## SwiftUICoordinator 
An example of building MVVM-C using SwiftUI. How to implement UIKit like Coordinator pattern on our SwiftUI projects with MVVM architecture.

Rather than having a single coordinator for the whole app, we created multiple coordinators. It will fix the following issues/drawbacks of a Single coordinator

1. A single coordinator is responsible for handling all the navigations.
2. A single coordinator becomes too heavy when the app is scaling.
3. A single coordinator knows too much and it is hard to modularise the app.
4. A single coordinator becomes less readable & hard to maintain when the app grows.

## Project Status
1. Current implementation demonstrates the use of multiple Coordinators in Navigation.
2. Coordinators for Nested Navigation inside tab item is in progress.
